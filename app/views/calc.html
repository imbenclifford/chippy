<h2>Let's talk numbers</h2>
<p>I earn £<input type="number" ng-model="earnings"> a 
<select ng-model="selected"
	ng-options="opt as opt.label for opt in options">
</select>
</p>

<p>I want to give <input type="number" ng-model="percentage">% of my income</p>

<p>That works out at about £{{perday() | number:0}} a day</p>

<h2>Now, let's talk chips.</h2>

<p>We're setting this up so giving once a day will be awesome but won't blow the bank.</p>

<p>If you end up posting three times a day then you'll be doing something wow-worthy and end up hitting that £{{perday()*365 | number:0}} a year figure. Wow.</p>

<p><h4>Each of your chips will be worth £{{perday()/3 | number:2}}.</h4></p>

<p><h2>Happy?</h2></p>
